You know those pens that make your handwriting look stunning, and bring out the best in all your doodled curlicues? If you don't, you really should get around to inventorying the world's expansive supply of mark-making tools, and I'd urge you to start with the very affordable Pentel Rolling Writer. I admire Pentel's retro designs across much of their writing utensil portfolio, and the Rolling Writers are no exception. But what I truly adore about these pens are their ability to produce lines of variable widths, which is a rarity in the roller ball arena. I should say that this very trait I'm touting is what many loathe in a pen, so it's not for everyoneâ€”particularly if you tend to hold your pens at an angle approaching perpendicular to your writing surface, which will result in a very thin, scratchy stroke. But for those with very angled grips, the ink flows freely. I keep a Rolling Writer on-hand in every purse, backpack, glove compartment, and desk drawer I own.

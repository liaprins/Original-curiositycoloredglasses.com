I"ý<p>Color-coding is an imperative part of my process when it comes to planning scripts and other complex code, so the more hues, the better. But thatâ€™s not the only criteria that these <a href="https://www.target.com/p/yoobi-153-mini-highlighters-multicolor-10-pack/-/A-15103318" target="_blank">mini highlighters</a> deliver on: each is only about the size of a blanket-less pig-in-a-blanket, but thatâ€™s exactly what attracted me to them in the Target school supply aisle in the first place. Not only are tiny things great for their cuteness value, theyâ€™re also convenient: Iâ€™ve toted all ten of these colorful liâ€™l fluorescence-dispensing piggies to many a coffee shop in one of my favorite (also tiny) zippered pencil pouches for a working session.</p>

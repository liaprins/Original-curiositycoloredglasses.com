question: How is windchill calculated?
---

Presumably it represents what the temperature feels like, after accounting for wind speed and maybe moisture levels, and I'm not sure what else. But what is the formula, and how did they arrive at it given that what something "feels like" seems somewhat unmeasurable if you ask me. Or maybe it doesn't actually represent the perceived temperature, but we've just been collectively interpreting it as that?

“Sauk” refers to the group's exonym (what others call them), “Ozaagii”, used by neighboring Ojibwe people to mean “those at the outlet” of the Saginaw River. This name was transliterated by the French, and eventually, the English, as “Sauk”. The group’s autonym (what they call themselves), “Oθaakiiwaki” means “people of the yellow earth.” *Definition from [Ohio History Central](https://ohiohistorycentral.org/w/Sauk_Indians){:target="_blank"}.*

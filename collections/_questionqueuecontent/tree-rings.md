question: Do indoor trees have tree rings?
---

Indoor- and greenhouse-grown trees don't experience annual weather patterns like their counterparts in the wild. Do they still grow thicker skin for the winter season "instinctively", or are tree rings exclusively reactionary responses to climate? If the former, how do trees track years and seasons without experiencing them, and how accurate are they?

Explanation: More specifically, those older manual varieties with the little lever that you had to flip to turn night-mode on or off: I think it did something two reflect the lights through a prism or something, but I could never quite tell from the outside. I guess it's time to go to the old car parts junk yard for one of these, to deconstruct it!

Heading: Edward Tufte's quartet of information visualization books

----

About: First, a few caveats: these are heady; take the time to fully fathom the text and examine the imagery (alternatively, have a look at my (link: https://www.instagram.com/dataviscliffsnotes/ text: in-progress "Cliffs notes" target: blank)). Take the words in these books with several salt grains and be selective about the truths you take away; designing for data and information is not black and white and there will always be best-practice tradeoffs. I found *The Quantitative Display of Visual Information* and *Envisioning Information* to be the best investment of my time, the other two largely re-hashed the same concepts and examples, providing diminishing returns. That being said, there are some very useful ideas and ideals analyzed at length in these books, and anyone serious about data and information visualization would be wise to dig into them deeply.

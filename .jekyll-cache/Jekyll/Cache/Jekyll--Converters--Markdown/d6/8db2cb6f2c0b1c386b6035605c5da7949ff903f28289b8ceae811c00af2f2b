I"«<p>This book will make you want to go explore North America on foot with nothing but a cute little mini traveling watercolor kit, or at least eat breakfast outside while sketching a squirrel. The pages are filled with snippets from the author-artistâ€™s own sketchpads, nestled in amongst 37 step-by-step painting tutorials. I take it down whenever I want some inspiration in the way of hand-rendered explanatory drawings.</p>

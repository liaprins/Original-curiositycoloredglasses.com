I"k<p>When donkeys and horses breed, does the resulting offspring really matter which is the female versus which is the male? If so, why? Probably something to do with chromosomes, but I need more information about this. And also how different are the two possible offspring types—mules and hinnies—and how do you tell one from the other? Furthermore, are donkeys and horses separate species? But if they are, how do they even produce offspring at all? And are the offspring separate species or sub-species, or how are they categorized? Lastly, how did all four of these animal varieties get their names, and why?</p>

question: If moths are nocturnal, why do they flock to lights?
binocsize: large

Moths could just come out during the day to get all the light they could ever want. They sure seem to like light when it's not a naturally occurring commodity. Does this mean something about the particular frequency of light they prefer? Maybe the sun doesn't specialize in the particular part of the visible light spectrum that they crave? Or is it more about the ratio of light—daytime is too intense for them? If so, this phenomena of light being available to them every night—thanks to human technology in the form of harnessed electricity—is a very recent development within the long span of animal evolution. How has it affected moth behavior?

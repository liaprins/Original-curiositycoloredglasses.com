Explanation: Monarchies are ridiculous relics of a past built on fate over freedom (in my occasionally not-so-humble but very democratic opinion). Nonetheless, I'd like some insight into the structure behind the destinies they propagate: who gets what title and what does it mean? How does it all fit together hierarchically?

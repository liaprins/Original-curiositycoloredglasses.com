question: Why does the moon always keep the same face toward earth?

This was the question that started it all. In seventh grade, while studying the orbits and rotations of the planets in the solar system, I realized that although Earth and the other planets rotated while we orbited the sun in such a way that the same hemisphere was not continually facing the sun, the same could not be said of the moon: it continuously keeps the same face toward Earth as it orbits. When I asked my teacher she said it was because the rate at which it rotates was perfectly aligned with the rate at which it orbits. It *would* have to be *perfectly* aligned; if either rate were off from each other by the slightest, it would begin to turn its "dark side" toward Earth, but it's kept the same face toward us for as long as humans have recorded it. Is this just a spookily serendipitous coincidence, or is there some hidden force syncing up the moon's rates of rotation and orbit?

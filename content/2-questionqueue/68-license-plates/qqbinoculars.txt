Explanation: 

Being the bookish youngster that I was, I naturally stashed a spiral-ringed notebook in the family minivan that I dedicated to keeping careful track of every repeating license plate letter-pattern I saw. Every page heading bore a three-character string of commonly spied license plates, like "XXX", "XXX", "XXX", or the notorious "GAK", which coincidentally and memorably started popping up around the time that the Nickelodeon Gack trend hit my elementary school.

It all started with the GAK plates. Once I'd seen one, I started to see them everywhere. And then I started to notice other recurring letter combinations, at seemingly staggering and unbalanced rates. But I could not be sure if I could trust my mind: maybe I just kept seeing the same cars over and over? Hence the notebook for careful tracking. According to my vigilant log-keeping, there *was* in fact a startling asymmetry to the proportions at which certain license plate letter-combinations occurred across Walla Walla. I started to keep "control" pages at the back of the book dedicated to randomly selected letter-combinations within the range that should have been printed on plates but which I had never noticed. Even with my eagle eyes on the look out for them, I rarely or never spotted these, but their front-of-the-notebook counterparts were all the while tallying up.

I had my hypotheses as to why certain letter-combinations would seem to cluster in my small city. The way I saw it, once you bought a new car, you were automatically enrolled to get the next license plate that came off the press. By my calculations, this meant that Walla Wallans were also buying cars in bunches, at least relative to the rest of the state. I figured they must be reacting to dealership sales.

It's been over twenty years, and I have yet to validate this hypothesis one way or the other, but there's no time like the near future! The first order of business is to run some basic probability tests: maybe the "clusters" I witnessed are in fact clusters, but still part of a normal, randomish distribution pattern.

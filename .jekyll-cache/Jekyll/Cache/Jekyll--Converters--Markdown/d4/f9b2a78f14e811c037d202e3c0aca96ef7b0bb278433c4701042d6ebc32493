I"û<p>Field guides are probably my favorite genre of all-time. I read them like novels, cover to cover, entranced by both the natural world and the organizational systems weâ€™ve applied to our understandings of it. Add in my weaknesses (in no particular order) for hand-painted illustrations, offset printing, the perfectly circular oâ€™s featured in the Futura typeface, thumbnail-sized maps, old paperbacks that can fit in my back pocket, and 1970s color palettesâ€”and itâ€™s no wonder that these quaint little retro Golden Guides topped my Christmas list last year. Have no fear, though: while I relish their charm, I do acknowledge that my copies are a few decades out of date, and I will be conducting my zoological and botanical fact checking elsewhere.</p>

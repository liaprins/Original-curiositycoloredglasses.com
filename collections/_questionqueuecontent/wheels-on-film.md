question: Why do wheels sometimes look like they're turning backwards in movies?
---

I have a theory that this depends upon the speed the wheels are traveling, the frame rate the video was filmed with, and the number of spokes (or other radial-type decor) on the wheels. Videos are just a series of still images flashed in sequence, so these still images might not capture the progression of each spoke evenly. One frame might show the a spoke at the top of the wheel. The next image might show this same spoke further along its radial trajectory. The spoke behind it will have moved the same distance, but within the timeframe between image captures, won't have moved quite to the top of the wheel yet. Since this spoke looks identical to the first spoke, we will instead perceive the spokes as moving backwards collectively, and at a bit slower rate than they are in truth moving forward. Now I just need to build out some models to test this.

Any of about 40 species of sharks possessing mottled patterns on the body that are evocative of carpet designs. They are found in all oceans but are concentrated in the Indo-Pacific and Australian regions. Many species are large, but they are not considered dangerous to humans, although they may protect themselves if harmed. Some species of carpet sharks bear live young, while others lay eggs. Many species of carpet sharks are bottom-feeders, primarily eating mollusks and crustaceans. *Definition from [Brittanica](https://www.britannica.com/animal/carpet-shark){:target="_blank"}.*

About: (link: https://processing.org/ text: Processing target: blank) is, in the words of the (link: https://processingfoundation.org/ text: foundation target: blank) behind it, "a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts". When I learned it as fledgling designer, I knew I'd caught the coding bug. (link: http://p5js.org/ text: p5.js target: blank) is even better, because it's an adaptation of Processing that can be built into websites so that its outputs can be shared across the web! Keep an eye out for the p5-dependent interactive modules—or sketches as they're called in Processing-speak—across my Curiosity-Colored Glasses posts!

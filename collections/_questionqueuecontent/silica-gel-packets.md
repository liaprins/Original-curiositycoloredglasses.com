question: How do silica gel packets work?
---

The little balls inside look so impenetrable, I am surprised they are the standard for maintaining low moisture levels. How do they compare to wads of cotton that come in Ibuprofen bottles (or are those just to keep the pills from breaking when shipped?) and those weird little ear-plug-looking things that came in bottles of Flintstones vitamins when I was a kid?

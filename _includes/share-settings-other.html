<!-- (I think) these tags are how search engines like Google know what to put with the provided link, and how to find it when people search. -->

<!-- The kirby starter kit directs the description to come from here (content/site.txt) -->
<!-- <meta name="description" content="<?php echo $site->description()->html() ?>"> -->

<!-- For now using the site tagline from the blog page's field in panel, same as for og:description, below -->
<!-- Or could pull each page's bit of text (more for About) to be specific to page, with "<?php echo ($page->text()); ?>" -->
<!-- Should test that this is directing properly -->
<!-- If want more characters (limit is 155; search engine won't parse or display more), could build a field into panel to hold description -->
<meta name="description" 				content="Looking at life's little mysteries through the same lens that killed the cat, and living to tell the tale.">

<!-- comma,separated,without,spaces -->

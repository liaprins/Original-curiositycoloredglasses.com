The pattern of reflected light (including light beyond the visible spectrum) that identifies a chemical or compound. Materials can be distinguished from one another at a distance by examining which portions of the spectrum they reflect and absorb. *Definition is my own, informed in large part by [ESRI](https://support.esri.com/en/other-resources/gis-dictionary/search/){:target="_blank"}.*

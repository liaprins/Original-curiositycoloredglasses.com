Heading: Coursera's Information Visualization classes

----

About: Coursera is an online class offerer, featuring instructors from many well-renowned universities. I audited all the (link: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/information-visualization text: Information Visualization target: blank) courses—led by NYU professor and researcher Enrico Bertini—for free, and it was more than worth every penny. The lessons covered practical considerations for designing data visualizations, and distilled a plethora of research around human visual perception into consumable nuggets. I filled a medium-sized Rollbahn notebook cover to cover with notes, and am still poring over what I learned to figure out how I can best apply it to my work.

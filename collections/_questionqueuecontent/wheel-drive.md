question: What does it mean when which wheels do the driving?
---

Four-wheel drive, all-wheel drive—what's the difference (assuming the all-wheel drive vehicle has just four wheels)? And amongst measly two-wheel drive vehicles, which is better under which conditions—front-wheel drive or rear-wheel drive? If one is always superior, why even manufacture the other variety? I'm on a mission to bring clarity to motor vehicle owners everywhere!

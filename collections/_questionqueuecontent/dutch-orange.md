question: Why is the color orange associated to The Netherlands?
---

My family is Dutch, and my parents inherited a lovely little tea set that is my very favorite deep orangey red color.  I didn't think much about it being a Dutch-specific color until I watched their soccer team beat Brazil in the 2014 World Cup while donning all-orange uniforms and going by the collective nickname "Orange Crush". More recently I visited Amsterdam and bore witness to a constellation of orange in the form of tulips, t-shirts, and bicycles. But this color is not even in The Netherlands' national flag, so where'd it come from, and how did it come to be adopted by this nation?

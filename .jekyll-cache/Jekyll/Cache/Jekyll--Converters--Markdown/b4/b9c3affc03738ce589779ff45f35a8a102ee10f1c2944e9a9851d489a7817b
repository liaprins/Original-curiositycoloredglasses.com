I"š<p>Stephen Dubner, the host of this <a href="http://freakonomics.com/archive/" target="_blank">podcast</a> and co-author of a book or two of the same name, is my favorite interviewer on the air. He is unbiased but exceedingly personable in his interrogations after the truth, siding with nothing short of critical thought. He manages to measure the seemingly unmeasurableâ€”squishy social science things like the concept of creativity, for exampleâ€”revealing every detail of his protocol along the way, and sussing out and scrutinizing those of others he talks to. I listen to the show as much for its intriguing content as for Dubnerâ€™s journalistic methods.</p>

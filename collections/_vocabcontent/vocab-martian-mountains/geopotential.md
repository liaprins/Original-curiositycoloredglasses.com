The amount of work that must be done against the Earth’s gravitational field in order to raise a mass from sea level to that point. A field of points where that amount of work is the same forms a geopotential plane. *Definition is my own, informed by [University of North Carolina Asheville’s Atmospheric Sciences Department](http://www.atms.unca.edu/chennon/notes/atms310/geopotential.pdf){:target="_blank"}.*

word: census area

The remainder of Alaska's land not belonging to boroughs is divided into 11 census areas, each roughly corresponding to an election district. These areas exist solely for the purposes of statistical analysis and presentation; they have no government of their own. *Definition from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unorganized_Borough,_Alaska){:target="_blank"}.*

Question: Do salamanders and other amphibians start out as tadpoles too?

Explanation: I've never actually learned about the life cycle of any amphibian besides frogs. Everyone seems to learn about frogs metamorphosing from tadpoles, but maybe this is just because it is more dramatic and interesting to see an animal with a tail change into one without it, whereas salamanders and most other amphibians already have tails. But is also taken for granted that if you collect a bucket of tadpoles they will turn into frogs. Has any kid ever been surprised by a bucket of salamanders instead? If not, is this because salamanders do *not* start out as leg-less polliwogs?

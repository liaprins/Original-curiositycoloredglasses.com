question: Are pumpkins hollow vacuums?
---

Everyone who's ever carved a Jack-o-lantern is aware of the fact that pumpkins are hollow. But what, if anything, fills this seemingly empty void within them before we pierce their exteriors and let air in? Are pumpkins vacuums, fighting against imminent implosion with their tough spherical forms? Spheres are the strongest shape when it comes to absorbing external force (need to verify; opposite vector of a baby chick trying to push out from inside of an egg shell). Maybe pumpkins are semi-permeable, letting air in from the outside, or even producing their own gasses to balance the pressure of Earth's atmosphere.

I have the beginnings of an experimental protocol in mind: I will fill a tub with water, submerge a pumpkin, and cut it open from beneath the surface of the water. If air bubbles emerge, that means it is filled with gas of some kind.

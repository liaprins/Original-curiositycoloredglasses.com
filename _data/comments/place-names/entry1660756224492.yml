message: "Thank you all! \r\n\r\nAnd I will update the data for some of those Massachusetts counties (for some reason the JSON with the SVG data for the county shapes sorts the \"City of...\" counties in a different order than the CSV I made with the actual etymology data, so they didn't always match up and need to be manually re-ordered (this also happened for all the counties starting with \"Mc...\" and \"St\" / \"Saint\", \"El \", \"Las \" and \"Los \", et which I mostly found on my own initially at least as far as I know, but very annoying!). But I'm happy to have help in making it more accurate!"

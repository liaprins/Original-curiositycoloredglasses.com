Question: How is the caffeine removed from whole coffee beans?

----

Explanation: 

You can buy whole, decaffeinated coffee beans. Preliminary research has revealed to me that these caffeine-less beans are not bred or otherwise genetically modified to grow this way, but that the caffeine is removed from them after harvest...somehow. I can more easily imagine already ground coffee in significantly smaller granular pieces with a higher surface-area-to-volume ratio being processed from the outside-in to extract the chemical caffeine, but how does this process happen, and how does it reach all the way into the insides of the whole beans? 

Furthermore, why haven't coffee plants been bred to grow caffeine-less beans in the first place? Or have they?

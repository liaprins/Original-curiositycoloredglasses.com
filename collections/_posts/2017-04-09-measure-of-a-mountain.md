excerpt: On maps, a mountain’s height is always shown solely as its peak’s elevation above sea level. This seems like a bit of a cop-out &#58; is the mountain itself really that tall? Or is it just standing on the shoulders of a very tall plateau, so to speak? Then again, determining the base from which to measure any mountain seems like quite the slippery slope once you get down to it, so I do understand and sympathize with the sea level approach adopted by us Earthlings. But what about pinnacle-filled planets and moons that lack oceans—(how) do we measure their mountains? And even on Earth, how are the high and low tides of sea level reconciled in order to arrive at heights so specific that they often indicate individual feet, and even inches in some cases?

share: Is Everest really 29,029 feet tall? Or just that many feet above sea level? Answer&#58; both. So how are mountains on sea-less Mars measured?

Unfortunately, sea level is not level. The distance from the center of the Earth to the coast­line is different around the world, not only because of winds and weather, but also as a result of the Earth's midsection bulge, which causes water {and everything else} to spread out at the equator. In addition, Earth is lumpy, with massive topographical features {such as mountains} altering the gravity in surrounding areas.

In the long run, though, snow might actually be more of a bane than a boone for a mountain’s height. Geologists had wondered for a while whether it was just a coincidence that taller peaks tended to cluster closer to the equator. That was until research into erosion rates done by David Egholm of Aarhus University in Denmark revealed that the slow, [tectonic-collision]-fueled growth of most mountains is no match for the mountain-munching forces of glaciers and ice. The snowline of crests at lower latitudes is likely to lie at a much higher elevation compared to the those of their more polar peaks, many of which are coated in a thick blanket of snow from tip to toe year round--and by blanket I mean gritty sandpaper that scours a mountain’s surface away, whole boulders at a time. This means that unless you’re lucky enough to be a Himalayan peak or a pinnacle in one of a handful of rare ranges whose vertical growth outpaces the damage done by glacial erosion, your height is likely to top off at about [1,500 meters] above your snowline, which in turn would seem to favor the equatorial summits, the snowlines of which are [staved off to higher elevations by their more tropical climates].

I love this planet. That's why I have such a cool pen. The magnitude-7.8 earthquake that rocked Nepal in April 2015 may have changed the Himalayas' heights buy a couple of inches at most. But just how do scientists measure that miniscule level of change?

Official measures put Mount Everest at 29,029 feet (8,848 meters) above sea level, but recent satellite data suggest the sky-scraping peak may have shrunk by about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters), because the un­derly­ing tectonic plates have relaxed somewhat. Even the alpine forests' tree rings were shaken. Regular text above 1.

Accurately measuring miniscule changes in a mountain that is more than 5 miles up is no easy feat, but surprisingly, measurements rely on geometric formulas and surveying techniques that haven't changed all that much since the 1800s, said Peter Molnar, a mountainous geologist at the University of Colorado, Boulder.

"If you have two angles, you know the third, because the sum of the angles is 180 [degrees]," Molnar told Live Science.

To carry out these measurements, surveyors must identify a horizontal surface using a level (which, like the kind at a hardware store, relies on a trapped air bubble that, under the influence of gravity, slides closer to or farther away from a central region as it tilts). From there, surveyors eye the summit and measure the angle with the assistance of a glorified, highly accurate protractor — a telescopic device known as a theodolite. With two angles and one side of a triangle, trigonometry reveals the lengths of the other sides, and thereby, the height of the triangle (the mountain). Regular text above 5.

Of course, one measure could be mistaken, so teams of geographers calculated the dimensions of the mountain from myriad different stations at the base of the mountain, averaging out the heights calculated with many, many triangles. Regular text above 6.

"They didn't expect anybody to believe it, so the story is they added 2 feet [0.6 m], just to make it look more believable," Molnar said.

When a satellite pings a receiver tower on Earth, it can calculate that point's location in a given coordinate system with incredible precision; the calculation relies on two known factors: the radio signal travels at the speed of light; and the satellite is located at a known position relative to the Earth's center at a given time. Because geographers placed a receiver tower near the top of Everest, they were able to get a more precise measure of its height.

That means the distance between two points on the ground is actually an underestimate, and the error is proportional to the distance between the two points divided by the radius of the Earth. That means two surveying stations can't be more than a few miles apart before reasonable amounts of error creep in, Molnar said.

And even that is an approximation. The Earth isn't perfectly spherical; it has a bulge at the equator, making the poles 16 miles (26 km) closer to the center of the Earth than a point on the equator. To account for that discrepancy, surveyors need to add another correction term, Molnar said.

Based on tradition, mountains are typically measured not from their bases, but from sea level, which is typically considered the average of the low and high tides in an area. Unfortunately, "sea level is not level," Molnar said. The distance from the center of the Earth to the coastline is different around the world, not only because of winds and weather, but also as a result of the Earth's midsection bulge, which causes water (and everything else) to spread out at the equator, Molnar said. In addition, Earth is lumpy, with massive topographical features (such as mountains) altering the gravity in surrounding areas.

"If you measured sea level coming from Calcutta to Nepal, or coming from Bombay, you might wind up with a different answer," Molnar said, referring to the Indian cities that are now called Kolkata and Mumbai, respectively.

The sea level in reference to Everest was first measured during the Great Trigonometric Survey, a Herculean effort to survey the height of the world's tallest mountains, to measure the curvature of the Earth and mean sea level in British India. People "carried in" sea level , bringing the measurement done at the coast inland by marching miles and miles from the coast to Nepal with two bars. They measured the elevation change over a given ground distance by calculating the difference between the height of the two bars using a mounted, swiveling level, according to the Himalayan Club, a climbing and expedition club that provides scholarly information and history on the Himalayas.

Nowadays, geographers use a mathematical expression to estimate sea level. They imagine what would happen if there were no winds or tides, and all the water from the seas could reach interior continental areas by means of tiny, narrow channels. This creates an idealized bumpy, irregularly shaped spheroid that represents mean sea level, called a geoid, from which elevations can then be measured, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Despite sophisticated gravimeters, complicated equations and fancy tools like global positioning systems, the elevation of Mount Everest is only precise to within a foot or two.

question: When does the sun rise and set across America?
---

It might at first seem like this question would have a terribly uninteresting and obvious answer. But there are so many variables to take into account! Longitude: the closer to the equator, the less sunrise and -set times are affected by the seasons, and vice versa. Latitude: the further East, the sooner to see the sun, and vice versa. Time zones: if I'm truly concerned with "time" of set and rise, then this is yet another factor to consider. Day of the year: see longitude, above. Surrounding terrain: if you're behind a mountain when the sun is said to have risen, but you're still in the mountain's shadow, *has* the sun in fact risen? What if you're just behind a hill or huge rock? At what land-formation size does it stop being pre-dawn, and start just being shade?

Which makes me wonder how they calculate the sunrise time for mountainous regions. Maybe they survey multiple locations for when the sun peaks over whatever ridge forms the horizon from that vantage point, and average them together: this school of thought considers the mountains as horizons, and the shade formed by them as "pre-dawn". Or maybe it's simply a calculation of when the sun should be considered to have risen, minus the mountains: in this school of thought the mountains simply form shade.

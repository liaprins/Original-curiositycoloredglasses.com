I"1<p>I am one of the (hypothesized) many adults who consider themselves both proud and avid fanatics of this exuberant <a href="https://tinkercast.com/shows/wow-in-the-world/" target="_blank">podcast</a> (which possibly considers itself aimed at children). Hosted by the hilariously paired and hyperbolic Mindy Thomas and Guy Raz, I am unceasingly in awe of their ability to pull me into their wondrously-imagined world, as much as I am of the pertinent scientific topics they examine. This podcast is a must-listen; I canâ€™t even choose a favorite episode.</p>

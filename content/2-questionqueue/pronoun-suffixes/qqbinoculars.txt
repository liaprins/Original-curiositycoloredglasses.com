Explanation: 

Bicyclist appends *ist* to bicycle, while biker appends *er* to bike: but why can't one be a *bicycler* or *bikist*? 
Does the preceding *l* indicate that *ist* must follow, and the preceding *k* that *er* must follow? 

Then you have the cities of Austin and Boston, which rhyme phonetically, but inhabitants of each turn out to be Austinites and Bostonians respectively.

Are there rules written somewhere for how to name doers of new contraptions and residents of new places, or is this all just language being fluid and I am over-analyzing everything?

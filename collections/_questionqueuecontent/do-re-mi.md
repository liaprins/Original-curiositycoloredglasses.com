question: Are there infinite “do re mi”s?

And perhaps more importantly, why are there seven repeating steps (do re mi fa so la ti *or* A B C D E F G), why not more or less, or why repeat note names at all? Is it arbitrary like days of the week, or is there some sort of music theory rationale to it?

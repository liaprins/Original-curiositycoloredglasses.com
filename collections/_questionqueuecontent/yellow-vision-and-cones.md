Primary colors—of which yellow is generally considered to be—are, by definition, colors that cannot be created by combining any other hues. Cones are the color receptors in the back of our eyes, and they can receive either red, blue, and *green* light. Not yellow! We have green cones, even though we are taught in school that green is a mix of yellow and blue... so how do we perceive isolated yellow colors when we would seem to have no method for intaking the information that is yellow light?

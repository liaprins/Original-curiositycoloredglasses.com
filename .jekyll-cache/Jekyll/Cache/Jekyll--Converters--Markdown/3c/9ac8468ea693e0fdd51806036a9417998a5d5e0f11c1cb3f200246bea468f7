I"*<p>Danny Gregory and Koosje Koene co-founded this <a href="https://klass.sketchbookskool.com/" target="_blank">purveyor of online courses</a> around art, drawing, making, and general creativity. You can tell that they and the artists and illustrators they invite to teach all love what they do. I follow along on their free <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnwAvNKzdoFgRyvXEBJBv0Q" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a> for behind-the-scenes interviews and tips, and am unceasingly inspired by the varying approaches and styles they showcase.</p>

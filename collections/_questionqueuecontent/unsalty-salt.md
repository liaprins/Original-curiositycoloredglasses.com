question: How does salt “lose its saltiness” over time?
binocsize: small

There is a Bible verse about salt "losing its saltiness" and being of no use, so this concept *must* be true. But how does a compound lose characteristic traits like that? Does it change in some other measurable way simultaneously, like how much it weighs?

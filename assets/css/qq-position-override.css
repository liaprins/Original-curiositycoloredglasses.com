/* Binocular images will be called by the code in iterative groups: S then M then L. 
But they should be arranged within the Kirby panel in an order that reflects the way they'll appear on the site. 
This way the CSS can properly target certain binoculars to override their default JavaScript-set positions and prevent them from blocking the text and menu.
This pattern within the Kirby panel should be as follows:
 Row 1: L S L S L S
 Row 2: S M S M S M
 Row 3: S L S L S L
 Row 4: S M S M S M
 Row 5: (start back over with top row pattern) */


/* 1225px and wider --------------------------------------
Starting at widest screenwidth and working down with mediaqueries (opposite method I usually employ)
so that at smaller sizes I can add display: none; to more binocular pairs as more start to overlap text */

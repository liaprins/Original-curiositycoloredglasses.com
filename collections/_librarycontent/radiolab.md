The original, almost hour-long episodes out of Radiolab are some of my very favorite science journalism. Flu-afflicted, I listened to the [Mimiviruses](https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/shrink){:target="_blank"} episode during an otherwise insufferable traffic jam in Tel Aviv and it made me nervous that the cars would start moving again before I could finish it. My other two favorites are about [chance](https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/91684-stochasticity){:target="_blank"} and [color](https://www.wnycstudios.org/story/211119-colors){:target="_blank"}.

I"%<p>You know you’ve discovered the world’s best ever comic strip artist when you set out to read their life’s work, planning to put a flag on every page that makes you literally laugh out loud, and you end up with <em>every single page flagged</em>. (Very dangerous if you do this while recovering from a tonsillectomy … consider yourself warned. Also be sure to stock up on sticky notes ahead of time.) Bill Watterson rolls wit, humor, and worldly perspective into one, through incredibly inventive illustrations and idiosyncratic character creation. I feel more than comfortable calling him a genius at what he does, and consider myself lucky to be living at a point and place in history that has allowed me to benefit from his brilliance (even if it set back my post-op healing time a bit).</p>

question: What’s up with some places having an alternative spelling and pronunciation?
binocsize: small

For example, in English we say and write "Munich", but in Germany—the place responsible for the official name of that city—it's "München". How are these alternative spellings and pronunciations determined when the native name is just that—a name, not necessarily a translatable concept? How did they come to be standardized enough to appear on maps?

What's up with English-speaking places calling it Munich, but Germans calling it München?

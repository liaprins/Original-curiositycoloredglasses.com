word: Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter
---

An instrument that measured Martian surface heights from aboard the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft, which orbited the planet for nearly a decade. To determine these heights, MOLA beamed laser pulses at Mars and measured the time it took them to return, resulting in a detailed topographic mapping of Mars. *Definition is my own, informed by [NASA](https://attic.gsfc.nasa.gov/mola/){:target="_blank"} and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Orbiter_Laser_Altimeter){:target="_blank"}.*

        <div class="qqdescription s-textface">You can buy whole, decaffeinated coffee beans. Preliminary research has revealed to me that these caffeine-less beans are not bred or otherwise genetically modified to grow this way, but that the caffeine is removed from them after harvest...somehow. I can more easily imagine already ground coffee in significantly smaller granular pieces with a higher surface-area-to-volume ratio being processed from the outside-in to extract the chemical caffeine, but how does this process happen, and how does it reach all the way into the insides of the whole beans?

Furthermore, why haven't coffee plants been bred to grow caffeine-less beans in the first place? Or have they?

        <div class="qqdescription s-textface">Equal transit time, also called longest path theory, claims that air molecules separated from one another when a wing slices between them must meet back up at the trailing edge of the wing. This purportedly results in a negative pressure zone caused by the upper molecules traveling a greater distance and therefore spreading further apart than their below-wing counterparts. I’ve never fully fathomed what I was taught in school about this phenomena: the alleged idea that lifeless air molecules are physically obligated to return to their original alignment, post-wing disruption, has baffled me since second grade. My confidence that the next flight I'm on will arrive safely depends on an understanding of the physics involved!

I didn't think much about it being a Dutch-specific color until I watched their soccer team beat Brazil in the 2014 World Cup while donning all-orange uniforms and going by the collective nickname "Orange Crush". More recently I visited Amsterdam and bore witness to a constellation of orange in the form of tulips, t-shirts, and bicycles. But this color is not even in The Netherlands' national flag, so where'd it come from, and how did it come to be adopted by this nation?

This mysterious phenomena does remind me of what happens when the tide comes in at the beach and covers up all the little crab holes in the sand, and bubbles stream from the holes to the surface. But I also doubt that microorganisms' exhales are directly responsible for the never-ending surge of bitty bubbles rising from the depths of every champagne flute. (*In*directly, maybe, in so far as champagne wouldn't have any carbonation if not for yeasts.)

So there is helium floating around the sun presumably, and in Earth's atmosphere. As a little kid, I always imagined a person in a launched rocket sticking their arm out the window while wielding a little butterfly net and swishing it all around to catch every helium molecule they could. Of course they couldn't really use nets, even with the most microscopic mesh, since helium is the second-smallest regularly occurring molecule (also need to verify how far materials science has come in the helium-filterable-nanoparticle-mesh department). But in any case, I strongly doubt that the imagination of my four-year-old self is correct in this matter (unfortunately). So...how do we *really* get helium?

Or is it just standing on the shoulders of a very tall plateau, so to speak? Then again, determining the base from which to measure any mountain seems like quite the slippery slope once you get down to it, so I do understand and sympathize with the sea level approach adopted by us Earthlings. But what about pinnacle-filled planets that nonetheless lack oceans: how are their mountains measured? And even on Earth, how are high and low tides reconciled in order to arrive at such specific heights down to individual feet and even inches in some cases?

Maybe the sun doesn't specialize in the particular part of the visible light spectrum that they crave? Or is it more about the ratio of light—daytime is too intense for them? If so, this phenomena of light being available to them every night—thanks to human technology in the form of harnessed electricity—is a very recent development within the long span of animal evolution. How has it affected moth behavior?

        <div class="qqdescription s-textface">To make a tube, you can roll a flat, two-dimensional material and connect its edges, like those construction paper chains kids make. You could also build up its circumference layer by layer, the way tube socks are knitted or the colosseum was built. Finally, you could start with a cylindrical form and carve out its center, the way hollow logs' insides rot away over time, leaving a tubular shell.

To my knowledge, the pasta industry does not employ any of these methods: according to Mister Roger's Neighborhood, noodles are extruded by pushing dough through holes of various shapes and angles. While accruing this knowledge was very enlightening and mesmerizing to me as a child, it cannot account for the holes in macaroni and other pasta forms: the extrusion machine's hole would need to have an inner circle "floating" within the main extrusion hole, to prevent dough from filling the core of the macaroni noodle. But how could that inner core-creating circle be held in place, without also slicing apart at least one side of the macaroni tube?

(Also, how are PVC pipes made? I am beginning to believe that my compilation of tube-creation methods is incomplete.)

        <div class="qqdescription s-textface">Zip codes seem to me to be a sequential, one-dimensional, quantitative nomenclature plopped onto the *two*-dimensional surface that is the constellation of the United States' population. There is a vague pattern in that zip codes with lower values are assigned further east, while higher values are assigned to the West, the reverse of the US Interstate's numbering system. But how are other nuances of location accounted for, if at all? And when are new zip codes assigned, if at all? Are remaining zip codes in short supply? And what about those extra, seemingly optional 4-digit extensions to every zip code? Hmmmmm.

Or are cold liquids also perceived by our nerves to be relatively warmer than they would have been if sipped straight from the cup? Maybe we don't notice this phenomena with cold liquids because they don't threaten to char our tongues for eternity like straw-sipped hot liquids do?

Or, as my ever-sensible mom suggested to me, the liquid must be hotter at the bottom of the cup, where the straw pulls from, than the top, where the liquid touches air. This had not even occurred to me [insert face-palm emoji]. But still we must test to verify!

        <div class="qqdescription s-textface">When I had a manicure they took me over to a drying station, which did not have a fan, but did have UV lights. They told me to put my freshly painted fingernails under the lights to cure them. This worked, although I didn't have a control to compare it to. In hindsight I should have only put one hand under and then compared my two hands' rates of drying... maybe a good excuse to get another manicure, in the name of science! But assuming UV does act as a catalyst for curing nail polish, how does it do it? And does it have to be used exclusively with a certain type of nail polish containing special UV-sensitive ingredients?

This implies an early understanding that insects breathe, just like other inhabitants of the animal kingdom. Well, maybe not *just like* other animals—how similar are insects' cardiovascular systems to ours? Do they have lungs? Do water beetles have gills? They aren't usually red when you squish them (except mosquitoes...), so that would seem to imply that they don't possess iron-toting red blood cells to do the job of oxygenating their various bodily systems. So how do bugs breathe?

And they have only one lens, unlike the two eyes most animals have, which I had always assumed made it possible for us to detect depth via parallax. So how do cameras do this? What if I put a printed, one-dimensional photograph in front of a camera: would the camera freak out trying to focus on what seems to be true depth? How would it even know, though? And how does this compare to how the human eye(s) would respond?

Everyone seems to learn about frogs metamorphosing from tadpoles, but maybe this is just because it is more dramatic and interesting to see an animal with a tail change into one without it, whereas salamanders and most other amphibians already have tails. But it also seems to be taken for granted that if you collect a bucket of tadpoles they will turn into frogs. Has any kid ever been surprised by a bucket of salamanders instead? If not, is this because salamanders do *not* start out as leg-less polliwogs?

        <div class="qqdescription s-textface">Being the bookish youngster that I was, I naturally stashed a spiral-ringed notebook in the family minivan that I dedicated to keeping careful track of every repeating license plate letter-pattern I saw. I had my hypotheses as to why certain letter-combinations seemed to cluster in my small city. The way I saw it, once you bought a new car, you were automatically enrolled to get the next license plate that came off the press. By my calculations, this meant that Walla Wallans were also buying cars in bunches, at least relative to the rest of the state. I figured they must be reacting to dealership sales.

It's been over twenty years, and I have yet to validate this hypothesis one way or the other, but there's no time like the near future! The first order of business is to run some basic probability tests: maybe the "clusters" I witnessed are in fact clusters, but still part of a normal, random-ish distribution pattern.

        <div class="qqdescription s-textface">I never thought that the potential energy caused by a charge-type disparity depended on the charge type itself. That is, why would it matter if the built up charge was positive or negative, and how would you really even know? But then, I was helping the kid I tutor with his science homework, which involved reading about lightning storms. This proved very enlightening and thought provoking for me, because the reading passage claimed that positively charged lightning storms are especially dangerous, "as observed in spring of 1998". But it did not go into any more detail.

So now I need to know exactly what went down in the "spring of 1998", and why positively charged electrical storms are somehow so much worse. Are positive charges in general more powerful than negative charges, or just when it comes to the context of lightning? Either way, why?

One thing I have been intrigued by since I first bore witness to it, is an italic effect sometimes produced when the letters run horizontally across the board. How can slanted lines—the fundamental structure behind italic type—be simulated on a perfectly parallel, vertical, and extremely low-resolution grid?

Since I've only ever seen this phenomena when the text was running horizontally, not vertically, I am wondering if somehow the timing of each row of L.E.D.s is ever so slightly staggered, resulting in an optical illusion of leaning vertical lines.

        <div class="qqdescription s-textface">Only 5% of naturally occurring grape plants can self-pollinate; the others are either male or female plants exclusively and as a result produce far fewer grapes and ultimately far fewer seeds. Modern wine grapes were bred from the self-pollinating 5% for this very reason: the ability to consistently provide fruits for harvest.&#42; What I don't understand is why only 1/20th of all grape plants have evolved in this way. It seems a much more efficient mechanism for passing along their DNA—and *all* of their DNA at that; no need to dilute it with half of another plants'. And given that they consistently produce more fruit and seeds, it would seem that they'd have easily surpassed the 5% mark over time. For that matter, why haven't all plant types evolved beyond the limits of male-female dependency? But I am especially baffled by grapes, some of which *have* evolved this mechanism, but seem to be stifled from taking over the grape-world. Maybe the male-female plant dynamic forces DNA mixing, which acts as insurance against genetic mutations and diseases?

&#42;This all according to the podcast "Science for the People"'s episode about wine... a very fascinating listen!

        <div class="qqdescription s-textface">I have two main theories on this right now. Maybe they want to prevent you from being able to return the items after wearing them, and they can tell if you wore them because you would have wanted to use the pockets and so would have un-done the stitching. *Or* maybe too many people were accidentally leaving their keys or phone or goldfish crackers, etc in the pockets when they tried them on. That might seem to be a strange hypothesis, but I have found a pair of keys in a coat I tried on (the brand of which did not employ this stitching shut methodology), and a sunglasses lanyard (not sold by the store) in the pocket of a sweatshirt I tried on once.

Pedaling means my legs still go up and down and forward and back in a way that's much like walking, so how does adding two wheels and some gears to the equation make up so much distance?

Yes, that sounds miserable, but not compared to *killing* an amazingly intelligent creature of which thousands of dollars have probably already been invested. In Sri Lanka I saw an elephant that had stepped on a land mine and it would never walk again, but they didn't kill it. Also, my cousin works for a veterinarian and has put a cast on a calf with a broken leg—what's stopping that from being the default for horses?

Furthermore, shooting seems such an inefficient and cruel death, hopefully they at least get a vet to euthanize them, but somehow I had heard they shoot them. Reform is in order if so.

But what, if anything, fills this seemingly empty void within them before we pierce their exteriors and let air in? Are pumpkins vacuums, fighting against imminent implosion with their tough spherical forms? Spheres are the strongest shape when it comes to absorbing external force (need to verify; opposite vector of a baby chick trying to push out from inside of an egg shell). Maybe pumpkins are semi-permeable, letting air in from the outside, or even producing their own gasses to balance the pressure of Earth's atmosphere.

I have the beginnings of an experimental protocol in mind: I will fill a tub with water, submerge a pumpkin, and cut it open from beneath the surface of the water. If air bubbles emerge, that means it is filled with gas of some kind.

Cones are the color receptors in the back of our eyes, and they can receive either red, blue, and *green* light. Not yellow! We have green cones, even though we are taught in school that green is a mix of yellow and blue... so how do we perceive isolated yellow colors when we would seem to have no method for intaking the information that is yellow light?

        <div class="qqdescription s-textface">I have a theory that this depends upon the speed the wheels are traveling, the frame rate the video was filmed with, and the number of spokes (or other radial-type decor) on the wheels. Videos are just a series of still images flashed in sequence, so these still images might not capture the progression of each spoke evenly. One frame might show the a spoke at the top of the wheel. The next image might show this same spoke further along its radial trajectory. The spoke behind it will have moved the same distance, but within the timeframe between image captures, won't have moved quite to the top of the wheel yet. Since this spoke looks identical to the first spoke, we will instead perceive the spokes as moving backwards collectively, and at a bit slower rate than they are in truth moving forward. Now I just need to build out some models to test this.

It seemed inhumane that as a society we'd all just be fine with storing living organisms inside of claustrophobic little foil pouches, only to pull them out and use their alive-ness for our own convenience before brutally baking them to death. But very recently I developed a metaphor that I *think* more accurately reflects the reality of yeast: those little particles patiently awaiting us in their foil pouch homes are more like *seeds*. Like barley or apple pips. When they are exposed to the proper environment, they multiply, kind of like plant seeds start to grow when given moisture and light.

However, this metaphor brought up a much bigger conceptual quandary: are *seeds* living? Do they fit the definition of "alive"? Do they fit the definition of "dead"? Or are they destined to wander aimlessly in plant purgatory until they happen upon the circumstances that will conjure them from this mysterious state?

Geometry was my all-time favorite class I have maybe ever taken, despite that fact that Ms. Jacky sent me to detention on more than one occasion for asking too many questions, one of which was this. No one in the class even understood what I was asking, including Ms. Jacky, and the fact that my teacher and all my classmates were willing to swallow the SOHCAHTOA formula we'd been taught hook, line and sinker, without bothering to question its origins, incensed me. The real issue with this particularly opaque formula is that it relies on parameters that change depending upon the knowns of a triangle's sides' lengths and angles' measurements. We had to look up these parameters in the back of our math books, or rely on our scientific calculators' outputs—either way, without having an understanding of how *those* parameters were ultimately and originally determined. It is time I learn the truth and share it with all the many geometry students the world over who have been kept in the dark, or worse—relegated to detention simply for seeking knowledge!

        <div class="qqdescription s-textface">This was the question that started it all. In seventh grade, while studying the orbits and rotations of the planets in the solar system, I realized that although Earth and the other planets rotated while we orbited the sun in such a way that the same hemisphere was not continually facing the sun, the same could not be said of the moon: it continuously keeps the same face toward Earth as it orbits. When I asked my teacher she said it was because the rate at which it rotates was perfectly aligned with the rate at which it orbits. It *would* have to be *perfectly* aligned; if either rate were off from each other by the slightest, it would begin to turn its "dark side" toward Earth, but it's kept the same face toward us for as long as humans have recorded it. Is this just a spookily serendipitous coincidence, or is there some hidden force syncing up the moon's rates of rotation and orbit?

Whereas the west seems to be dominated by Native American names, the East is peppered with old-school Englishy-sounding monikers. It makes me wonder how correlated the various nomenclatures are to the dates of their cities' founding, and the time and way in which the land they lay upon was acquired.

If I made a map categorizing each city's name type, what would it reveal? Could I trace the border's of each subsequent parsel of land purchased and instated to the Union by its city's name types alone?

The leaves are too tiny to gather much chlorophyll energy from the sun and also there is not enough time for them to send energy down to store in their roots since each leaflet only exists for less than one day in the first place! It definitely takes more energy to grow a stalk than the stalk collects in its short life and sends down to the roots, so how does this math equation work out?

Since then I have noticed all sorts of penmanship idiosyncrasies, often tied to the country of the writer's birth. I want to catalog these handwriting conventions of the latin alphabet, character-by-character, and trace them back to their roots.

        </div>
        <div class="qqdescription s-textface">It might at first seem like this question would have a terribly uninteresting and obvious answer. But there are so many variables to take into account! Longitude: the closer to the equator, the less sunrise and -set times are affected by the seasons, and vice versa. Latitude: the further East, the sooner to see the sun, and vice versa. Time zones: if I'm truly concerned with "time" of set and rise, then this is yet another factor to consider. Day of the year: see longitude, above. Surrounding terrain: if you're behind a mountain when the sun is said to have risen, but you're still in the mountain's shadow, *has* the sun in fact risen? What if you're just behind a hill or huge rock? At what land-formation size does it stop being pre-dawn, and start just being shade?

Which makes me wonder how they calculate the sunrise time for mountainous regions. Maybe they survey multiple locations for when the sun peaks over whatever ridge forms the horizon from that vantage point, and average them together: this school of thought considers the mountains as horizons, and the shade formed by them as "pre-dawn". Or maybe it's simply a calculation of when the sun should be considered to have risen, minus the mountains: in this school of thought the mountains simply form shade.

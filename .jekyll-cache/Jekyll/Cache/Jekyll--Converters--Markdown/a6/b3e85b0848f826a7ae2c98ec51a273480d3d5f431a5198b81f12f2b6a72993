I"g<p>We hosted a Spanish exchange student over the summer one year in high school and I noticed that she wrote her lowercase <em>a</em>’s by making a <em>U</em>, then a cursive <em>o</em>’s loop at the top, before descending to create the <em>a</em>’s tail. When I asked her about it, she said that was how they always learned to make them in school.</p>

<p>Since then I have noticed all sorts of penmanship idiosyncrasies, often tied to the country of the writer’s birth. I want to catalog these handwriting conventions of the latin alphabet, character-by-character, and trace them back to their roots.</p>

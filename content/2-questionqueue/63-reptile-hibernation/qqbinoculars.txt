Explanation: What do reptiles do in winter in snowy places? I assume they retreat down into burrows below the frostline â€¦  But then how do they even get enough energy in the spring to wake up from hibernating down there in the first place? They need heat to warm their cold-blooded bodies but how do they get that heat if they're hidden away from the sun in their burrows?

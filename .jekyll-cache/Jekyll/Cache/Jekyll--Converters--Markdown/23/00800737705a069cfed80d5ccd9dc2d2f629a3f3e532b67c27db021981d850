I"€<p>When I first saw this book for sale in a coffee shop I instantly felt less alone in the world, simply based on the fact that there was a market serving the intersection of doodlers and lovers of tiny objects. I crack this book open whenever I feel like drawing but canâ€™t come up with a prompt of my own, or am feeling too perfectionist-y to draw loosely and need to warm up.</p>

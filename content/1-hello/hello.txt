Each post investigates a question from an ever-evolving collection that I've been curating since seventh grade (see the (link: questionqueue text: Question Queue target: blank) for my shortlist). I designed and built this website from scratch so that I could freely explore and accommodate unique ways to encourage others’ understanding. As a visual learner and a data vis designer by trade, I employ imagery and interaction to explain the answers I uncover, but attempt to put an equal emphasis on the story behind each of my investigations.

Deeper dives into my process, as well as tangential thoughts on code and creativity can be found on my “meta-blog,” (link: https://medium.com/@liajprins text: The Method to My Madness target: blank); for more of my design work, visit my (link: https://liaprins.com/ text: portfolio target: blank).

If you have a quandary of your own that deserves in-depth analysis, I'd love to hear it! Send (link: https://twitter.com/CuriosityColor text: @CuriosityColor target: blank) a tweet or email me at [hello@curiositycoloredglasses.com](mailto:hello@curiositycoloredglasses.com).

Hellotext: Welcome to my blog! I’m Lia, and this is where I examine the wonderfully perplexing world we live in and report back my findings. I’m a self-proclaimed visual learner and a software designer by trade, but I love to write, so I decided to start Curiosity-Colored Glasses as a way to educate myself (and potentially others) through imagery and explanations. Happy looking and learning! You can see my other projects here.

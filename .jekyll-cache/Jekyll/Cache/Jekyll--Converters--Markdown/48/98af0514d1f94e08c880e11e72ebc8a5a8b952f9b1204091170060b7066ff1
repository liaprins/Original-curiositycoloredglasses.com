I"ª<p>Do clouds fit neatly into their typical little categories like cumulonimbus and cirrus, or are there cloud hybrids? If so, which cloud types or cloud creation methods are ever mixed? Are any existing cloud types actually just half-steps between two other types? If so, can the cloud taxonomy be considered a spectrum? Is it a hierarchy? What is the best way to visually structure the relationships between cloud types?</p>

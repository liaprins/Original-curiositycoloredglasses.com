Explanation: Bicycles are the quintessential invention. I am continuously in awe of how far I can pedal before I've even had breakfast, powered by the glycogen in my legs alone. But I haven't quite mentally sorted out the physics behind these miracle machines. Pedaling means my legs still go up and down and forward and back in a way that's much like walking, so how does adding a wheel and some gears to the equation make up so much distance?

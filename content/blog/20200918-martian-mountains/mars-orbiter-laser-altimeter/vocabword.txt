Definition: An instrument that measured Martian surface heights from aboard the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft, which orbited the planet for nearly a decade. To determine these heights, MOLA beamed laser pulses at Mars and measured the time it took them to return, resulting in a detailed topographic mapping of Mars. <em>Definition is my own, informed by <a href="https://attic.gsfc.nasa.gov/mola/" target="_blank">NASA</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Orbiter_Laser_Altimeter" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>.</em>

I"Œ<p>Charley Harperâ€™s prolific compendium of paintings, posters, murals, and more combine my love of the natural world with my fondness for modern geometric lines and grid systems. This digest serves as a visual stroll through Harperâ€™s career as an artist, biology book illustrator, and conservationist. I pull it off the shelf any time I need to simplify a visual concept or illustration.</p>

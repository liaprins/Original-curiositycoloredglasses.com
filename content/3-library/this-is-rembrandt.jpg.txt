Heading: This is Rembrandt, illustrated by Nick Higgins

----

About: Nick Higgins' colorfully textured mixed media (link: https://nickhiggins.co.uk/2016/06/10/pronk-drawing-for-this-is-rembrandt/ text: illustrations target: blank) are delightful, and make me extra-grateful that I have accidentally amassed a huge shelf full of art supplies over the years. The style of the imagery in this book makes me want to use them all, and unsparingly, in my own illustrations for Curiosity-Colored Glasses posts.

Alt: A remake of a Rembrandt self-portrait, in teal.

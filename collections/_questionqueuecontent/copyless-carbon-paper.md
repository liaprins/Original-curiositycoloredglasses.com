question: How does that old pink and yellow pressure-sensitive carbon paper work?
binocsize: large

It's very strange to me because there is nothing dark on the back of any of the sheets, and yet when you write on the top layer (or even just scratch without ink) the next layer has an exact copy of what was written on the layer above it, that cannot be removed. Maybe there are tiny bubbles of ink embedded within each page that pop like itty bitty bubble wrap when pressure is applied? This seems like a stretch, but there also seems to be no other feasible explanation.

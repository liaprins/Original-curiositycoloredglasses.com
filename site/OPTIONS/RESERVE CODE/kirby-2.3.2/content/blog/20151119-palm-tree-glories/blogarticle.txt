Intro: I went on a road trip to northern California for (link: library#cousin-jason text: my cousin)â€™s wedding when I was in middle school. We drove past tons of palm trees, which at the time were my favorite tree (replaced by sequoias the following week). But there were so many different kinds: very tall skinny ones with pom-pom-like tufts at the top, stout hash-barked ones with very robust foliage, and some even with fan-shaped leaves. Plus did any have coconuts? we all wondered. Or maybe dates? This made me wonder if these various so-called palms were even all-that related to each other, since coconuts and dates do not seem to have much in common if you ask me.

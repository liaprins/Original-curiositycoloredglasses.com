Definition: A location on Earthâ€™s crust above magma that is extra-hot relative to the surrounding magma, due to thermal plumes arising from even deeper within the earth. This causes the crust to melt and weaken, resulting in volcanic activity. <em>Definition is my own, informed by <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/hot-spots/#:~:text=A%20hot%20spot%20is%20an,crust%20and%20widespread%20volcanic%20activity." target="_blank">National Geographic</a> and <a href="https://www.iris.edu/hq/inclass/animation/hotspot_volcanism_thermal_plume" target="_blank">Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology</a>.</em>

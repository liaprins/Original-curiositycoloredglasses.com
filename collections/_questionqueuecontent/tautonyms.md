question: Why do some living organisms have the same species and genus names, twice in a row?

For example, *Vulpes vulpes* is the red fox. It makes it seem like the quintessential species to represent the genus as a whole, but if that is the case (which I doubt), what would the criteria for quintessentialism be? Are there any species with the same name for their genus and family, and even order or beyond?

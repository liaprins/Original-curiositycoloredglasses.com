question: Yeast is living! But how?
---

I have been confused by this for most of my life (and in blatant disbelief of it when I was a kid). It seemed inhumane that as a society we'd all just be fine with storing living organisms inside of claustrophobic little foil pouches, only to pull them out and use their alive-ness for our own convenience before brutally baking them to death. But very recently I developed a metaphor that I *think* more accurately reflects the reality of yeast: those little particles patiently awaiting us in their foil pouch homes are more like *seeds*. Like barley or apple pips. When they are exposed to the proper environment, they multiply, kind of like plant seeds start to grow when given moisture and light.

However, this metaphor brought up a much bigger conceptual quandary: are *seeds* living? Do they fit the definition of "alive"? Do they fit the definition of "dead"? Or are they destined to wander aimlessly in plant purgatory until they happen upon the circumstances that will conjure them from this mysterious state?

Assuming there’s a more or less linear relationship between a volcano’s height and the gravity exerted upon it, an earth-bound Olympus Mons might have only ever grown to about 8.4 kilometers from base-to-summit.

(Finally a sketch that is more or less to scale! Although I did have to do some experiments and estimations (silly putty was involved) to get an approximation of Olympus Mons’ would-be diameter on Earth, assuming its volume stayed the same…)

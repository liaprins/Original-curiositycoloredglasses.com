question: How are zip codes assigned?

Zip codes seem to me to be a sequential, one-dimensional, quantitative nomenclature plopped onto the *two*-dimensional surface that is the constellation of the United States' population. There is a vague pattern in that zip codes with lower values are assigned further east, while higher values are assigned to the West, the reverse of the US Interstate's numbering system. But how are other nuances of location accounted for, if at all? And when are new zip codes assigned, if at all? Are remaining zip codes in short supply? And what about those extra, seemingly optional 4-digit extensions to every zip code? Hmmmmm.

question: Is a positive electrical charge more potent than a negative charge?
binocsize: small

I never thought that the potential energy caused by a charge-type disparity depended on the charge type itself. That is, why would it matter if the built up charge was positive or negative, and how would you really even know? But then, I was helping the kid I tutor with his science homework, which involved reading about lightning storms. This proved very enlightening and thought provoking for me, because the reading passage claimed that positively charged lightning storms are especially dangerous, "as observed in spring of 1998". But it did not go into any more detail.

So now I need to know exactly what went down in the "spring of 1998", and why positively charged electrical storms are somehow so much worse. Are positive charges in general more powerful than negative charges, or just when it comes to the context of lightning? Either way, why?

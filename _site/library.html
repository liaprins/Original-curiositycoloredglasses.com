            <p>Field guides are probably my favorite genre of all-time. I read them like novels, cover to cover, entranced by both the natural world and the organizational systems we’ve applied to our understandings of it. Add in my weaknesses (in no particular order) for hand-painted illustrations, offset printing, the perfectly circular o’s featured in the Futura typeface, thumbnail-sized maps, old paperbacks that can fit in my back pocket, and 1970s color palettes—and it’s no wonder that these quaint little retro Golden Guides topped my Christmas list last year. Have no fear, though: while I relish their charm, I do acknowledge that my copies are a few decades out of date, and I will be conducting my zoological and botanical fact checking elsewhere.</p>

(Very dangerous if you do this while recovering from a tonsillectomy … consider yourself warned. Also be sure to stock up on sticky notes ahead of time.) Bill Watterson rolls wit, humor, and worldly perspective into one, through incredibly inventive illustrations and idiosyncratic character creation. I feel more than comfortable calling him a genius at what he does, and consider myself lucky to be living at a point and place in history that has allowed me to benefit from his brilliance (even if it set back my post-op healing time a bit).</p>

He is unbiased but exceedingly personable in his interrogations after the truth, siding with nothing short of critical thought. He manages to measure the seemingly unmeasurable—squishy social science things like the concept of creativity, for example—revealing every detail of his protocol along the way, and sussing out and scrutinizing those of others he talks to. I listen to the show as much for its intriguing content as for Dubner’s journalistic methods.</p>

I’d recommend starting your journey to enlightenment with a copy of <em>Flatland</em>, and one with an introduction by Rosemary Jann. She sets Abbott’s story up in the context of the time it was written—just a decade or so prior to Einstein’s relativity work, when the notion of extra-dimensional thinking was just starting to be explored. <em>Flatland</em> drops its readers into a 2-D world with a square playing protagonist. I’ll let you read the riveting, geometry-heavy plot yourself, but I will say that if you adore walking, talking, inanimate objects a fraction as much as I do, you’ll be delighted to have A. Square as your guide to acquiring a higher understanding of the physical world.</p>

            <p>You know those pens that make your handwriting look stunning, and bring out the best in all your doodled curlicues? If you don’t, you really should get around to inventorying the world’s expansive supply of mark-making tools, and I’d urge you to start with the very affordable Pentel Rolling Writer. I admire Pentel’s retro designs across much of their writing utensil portfolio, and the Rolling Writers are no exception. But what I truly adore about these pens are their ability to produce lines of variable widths, which is a rarity in the roller ball arena. I should say that this very trait I’m touting is what many loathe in a pen, so it’s not for everyone—particularly if you tend to hold your pens at an angle approaching perpendicular to your writing surface, which will result in a very thin, scratchy stroke. But for those with very angled grips, the ink flows freely. I keep a Rolling Writer on-hand in every purse, backpack, glove compartment, and desk drawer I own.</p>

I audited all the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/information-visualization" target="_blank">Information Visualization</a> courses—led by NYU professor and researcher Enrico Bertini—for free, and it was more than worth every penny. The lessons covered practical considerations for designing data visualizations, and distilled a plethora of research around human visual perception into consumable nuggets. I filled a medium-sized Rollbahn notebook cover to cover with notes, and am still poring over what I learned to figure out how I can best apply it to my work.</p>

But that’s not the only criteria that these <a href="https://www.target.com/p/yoobi-153-mini-highlighters-multicolor-10-pack/-/A-15103318" target="_blank">mini highlighters</a> deliver on: each is only about the size of a blanket-less pig-in-a-blanket, but that’s exactly what attracted me to them in the Target school supply aisle in the first place. Not only are tiny things great for their cuteness value, they’re also convenient: I’ve toted all ten of these colorful li’l fluorescence-dispensing piggies to many a coffee shop in one of my favorite (also tiny) zippered pencil pouches for a working session.</p>

It’s extremely flexible and well documented, which is why I chose it: I couldn’t find any other CMS that would let me design and build-in all the little content-filled details I had in mind, while providing web performance equivalent to a static site. However, it was not an easy task at all; Kirby uses PHP, so I had to learn that coding language from scratch, the syntax of which leaves much to be desired. Kirby has a fantastically responsive forum though, and they helped me with nearly every challenge I encountered and could not solve through my own sheer will and external research.</p>

            <p>First, a few caveats: these are heady; take the time to fully fathom the text and examine the imagery (alternatively, have a look at my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dataviscliffsnotes/" target="_blank">in-progress “Cliffs notes”</a>). Take the words in these books with several salt grains and be selective about the truths you take away; designing for data and information is not black and white and there will always be best-practice tradeoffs. I found The Quantitative Display of Visual Information and Envisioning Information to be the best investment of my time, the other two largely re-hashed the same concepts and examples, providing diminishing returns. That being said, there are some very useful ideas and ideals analyzed at length in these books, and anyone serious about data and information visualization would be wise to dig into them deeply.</p>

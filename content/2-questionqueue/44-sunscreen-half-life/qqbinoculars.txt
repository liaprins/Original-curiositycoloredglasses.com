Explanation: If so, does the sunscreen “get used up” by the sunlight, and how long or how much sun intensity does it take? Is this the reason behind the reapplication instructions on every bottle of sunscreen, or is that just because they want you to use it up faster to buy more? Or maybe the reapplication instructions are simply to account for the cream wearing off or evaporating away over time, or maybe the sunscreen compounds are not directly "used up" by the sun, but are broken down by the light or heat over time?

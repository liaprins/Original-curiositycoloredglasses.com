question: Does pure hydrogen dioxide (water sans any minerals or other molecules) have a taste?

There are some other compounds that don't have detectable tastes or smells, so it is possible. But wouldn't pure H<sub>2</sub>0 taste different than the mineral-, chlorine-, and fluoride-filled water we might be accustomed to?

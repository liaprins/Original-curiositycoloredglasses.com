Explanation: How come water tension can bulge on a penny, but not to an equivalent height on a humungous 100-mile wide disc (at least I assume it can't â€¦)? A penny is still *enormous* compared to the individual water molecules responsible for water tension. So what is the size threshold for this water tension trick?

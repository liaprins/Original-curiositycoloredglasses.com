question: How are airports funded?
binocsize: small

Airports are expansive and expensive. Who pays for them compared to who benefits from them? What proportion of airline, local, and regional taxes are allocated to an airport? What about teeny tiny airports that exclusively fly into and out of a single major airport: do they contribute to the cost of the major airport, and/or vice versa? How do the funding models differ across the US, and the world? Nothing an up-and-coming wannabe data scientist can't suss out.

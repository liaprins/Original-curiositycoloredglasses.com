Explanation: 

Why does everything directly behind the toaster look wiggly when its on and toastily toasting some toast? I don't think I have ever had a proper explanation about this. Yes, I know it is caused by heat, but why is wiggly vision the outcome? 

Sidenote: the mirage effect is so ironically awful for anyone who's ever been lost in a desert, it's almost like the universe is playing jokes with this particular heat wave phenomena.

Heading: Trader Joe's Fearless Flyers

----

About: Trader Joe's sends out little newspaper-like missives every once in a while, cheekily and cheerfully touting the virtues of their newly stocked or seasonal items. I *love* reading them. I have a stack at least three inches high that I've been saving for years: they've survived every move and every massive apartment-wide purge I've ever undertaken in an attempt at minimalism. These grocery-centric (link: https://www.traderjoes.com/fearless-flyer text: newsletters target: blank) are just so joyous, silly, and self-aware; I dig into my stack whenever I need inspiration for finding my own writer's voice.

Alt: Spoon, fork, and knife in Trader Joe's signature Victorian-vintage style, with a modern twist.

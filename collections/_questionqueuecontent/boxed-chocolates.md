Are there *any* conventions for boxed chocolates in regards to intuiting their flavors? Do flavors tend to relate to certain external patterns, shapes, or designs? As a UX designer, can I determine a solution to bring at least a semblance of coherence and clarity to the terrifying prospect and inevitable FOMO of selecting the wrong chocolate from the box of them that someone brought to work?

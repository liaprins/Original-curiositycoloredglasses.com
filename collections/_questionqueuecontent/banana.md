question: What is that weird pointy looking thing at the end of a banana?
---

Is it a seed, or just some other totally normal part of a fruit that I was nonetheless scared of as a kid because it looked pokey? Maybe it is like the core that strawberries and raspberries have, or the pithy part in the middle of an orange. Also, banana plants are herbs, or so I hear. Are they supposed to taste herb-y?

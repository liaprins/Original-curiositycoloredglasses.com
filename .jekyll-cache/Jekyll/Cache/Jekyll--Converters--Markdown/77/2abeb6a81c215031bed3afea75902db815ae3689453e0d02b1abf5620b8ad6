I"²<p>Coursera is an online class offerer, featuring instructors from many well-renowned universities. I audited all the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/information-visualization" target="_blank">Information Visualization</a> coursesâ€”led by NYU professor and researcher Enrico Bertiniâ€”for free, and it was more than worth every penny. The lessons covered practical considerations for designing data visualizations, and distilled a plethora of research around human visual perception into consumable nuggets. I filled a medium-sized Rollbahn notebook cover to cover with notes, and am still poring over what I learned to figure out how I can best apply it to my work.</p>

Intro: My family had (link: library#japanese-schools text: two Japanese exchange students) stay with us when I was in high school. I was still in the process of refining my own handwriting into a delectable print-cursive combo that conveniently doubled as an encryption method that no one else could read. Point being, I was hyper aware of the shapes of other people’s letters, numbers, whether they used an “&” or a “+” or something in between. I noticed that both Japanese girls wrote their “4”s in a most peculiar way. And I also noticed (link: library#cecelia text: my friend from Spain) wrote her lowercase “a” in a completely different way than anything I had seen before: almost a cursive “o” but then adding the tail of the “a”. Of course all this made me very curious.

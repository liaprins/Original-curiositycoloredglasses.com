A location on Earthâ€™s crust above magma that is extra-hot relative to the surrounding magma, due to thermal plumes arising from even deeper within the earth. This causes the crust to melt and weaken, resulting in volcanic activity. *Definition is my own, informed by [National Geographic](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/hot-spots/#:~:text=A%20hot%20spot%20is%20an,crust%20and%20widespread%20volcanic%20activity.){:target="_blank"} and [Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology](https://www.iris.edu/hq/inclass/animation/hotspot_volcanism_thermal_plume){:target="_blank"}.*

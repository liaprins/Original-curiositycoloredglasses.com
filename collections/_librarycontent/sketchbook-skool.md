Danny Gregory and Koosje Koene co-founded this [purveyor of online courses](https://klass.sketchbookskool.com/){:target="_blank"} around art, drawing, making, and general creativity. You can tell that they and the artists and illustrators they invite to teach all love what they do. I follow along on their free [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnwAvNKzdoFgRyvXEBJBv0Q){:target="_blank"} for behind-the-scenes interviews and tips, and am unceasingly inspired by the varying approaches and styles they showcase.

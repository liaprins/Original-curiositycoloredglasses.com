I"˜<p>I am pretty sure there are not tiny leaks in every single champagne glass Iâ€™ve ever sipped from, letting in tiny snatches of air (though Iâ€™ll admit my sample size is itself tiny so far). This mysterious phenomena does remind me of what happens when the tide comes in at the beach and covers up all the little crab holes in the sand, and bubbles stream from the holes to the surface. But I also doubt that microorganismsâ€™ exhales are directly responsible for the never-ending surge of bitty bubbles rising from the depths of every champagne flute. (<em>In</em>directly, maybe, in so far as champagne wouldnâ€™t have any carbonation if not for yeasts.)</p>

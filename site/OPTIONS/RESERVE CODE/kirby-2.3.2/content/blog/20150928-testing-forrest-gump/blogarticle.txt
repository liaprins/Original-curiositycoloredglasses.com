Intro: Choosing a chocolate from a box of chocolates makes me wish I took a pocket knife everywhere, so I could just slice each chocolate open until I find an acceptable one, since it can be very difficult to discern their contents and flavor, despite their very varied external appearances. It made me wonder if there is a secret chocolate code I have never picked up on, that spans chocolate brands. Maybe the hazelnut creme filled ones are always dome shaped with a sprinkle of sugar on top? Certainly there is a method to this madness that is the chocolate box industry. Or maybe not. But there is only one way to find out for sure: eat every kind, from every brand! Luckily (link: library#imaginary-boyfriend text: my imaginary boyfriend) brings me a box of chocolates every week.

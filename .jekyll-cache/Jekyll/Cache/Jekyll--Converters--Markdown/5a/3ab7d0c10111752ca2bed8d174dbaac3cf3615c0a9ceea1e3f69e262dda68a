I"–<p>I have heardâ€”from a co-worker, who heard from a tour guide in Hawaiâ€™i (more fact checking to come)â€”that a single pineapple takes two years to grow. Factor in the cost of Hawaiâ€™ian land and overseas climate-controlled shipping, and you have yourself an economic mystery â€¦  or at least a conspiracy theory waiting to be created. How are these things <em>not</em> worth their weight in gold?</p>

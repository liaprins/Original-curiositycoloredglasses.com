Explanation: Is there a threshold for this perceived temperature increase? Or are cold liquids also perceived by or nerves to be relatively warmer than they would have been if sipped straight from the cup? Maybe we don't notice this phenomena with cold liquids because they don't threaten to char our tongues for eternity like straw-sipped hot liquids do?

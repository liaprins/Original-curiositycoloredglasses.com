This is more than just an artistic coffee table book; it bears an honest and enlightening account of the struggles involved in making one's living as a creative. I love Niemann's [illustrations](http://www.christophniemann.com/portfolio/sunday-sketches-2/){:target="_blank"} as much for their cleverness as for their simplicity and craftsmanship: every line and ink wash is perfectly placed, in a way that comes off as effortless.

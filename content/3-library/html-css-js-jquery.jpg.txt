Heading: HTML & CSS + JavaScript & JQuery, by Jon Duckett

----

About: These are great books for any beginners looking to become semi-competent in browser-based code. However, be warned that they are a bit out of date: the <details\><summary\> HTML tags, CSS Variables, and JavaScript's <em>classList</em> method are not covered, and anyone building a website should know about them (I wish I'd known when I built this one!). Furthermore, media queries are not touched upon at all. Still, I referenced these books often as I built this site and am sure I will continue to rely on them as I go about my business squashing bugs.

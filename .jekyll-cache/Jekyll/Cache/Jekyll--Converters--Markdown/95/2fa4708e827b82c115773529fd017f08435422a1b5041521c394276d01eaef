I"«<p>Even within the US, there are some plugs with two prongs and some with three. Of the two-prong type, some of those have one prong thatâ€™s taller than that of their partner. What is the reasoning and benefit to having it one way or the other? And what would it take to align the world with one outlet style (preferably one that looks like a happy face, not the aghast-looking face formed by the current US three-prong)?</p>

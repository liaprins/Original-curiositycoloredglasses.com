Explanation: As someone who has intentionally avoided curating a sensitive palette so she can continue to purchase and enjoy Two Buck Chuck, I honestly cannot tell the difference between any of the fizzy water types. Are they all just synonyms for each other, or is their carbonation distracting my lazy tastebuds from distinguishing some subtle differences?

I"Ÿ<p>I have two main theories on this right now. Maybe they want to prevent you from being able to return the items after wearing them, and they can tell if you wore them because you would have wanted to use the pockets and so would have un-done the stitching. <em>Or</em> maybe too many people were accidentally leaving their keys or phone or goldfish crackers, etc in the pockets when they tried them on. That might seem to be a strange hypothesis, but I have found a pair of keys in a coat I tried on (the brand of which did not employ this stitching shut methodology), and a sunglasses lanyard (not sold by the store) in the pocket of a sweatshirt I tried on once.</p>

word: census area
---

Most of Alaska's land is divided into county-equivalents called boroughs. The remainder of the land is referred to as "The Unorganized Borough"; however, it is not actually a borough itself, as it forgoes that level of government structure. It is divided into 11 census areas, each roughly corresponding to an election district. These areas exist solely for the purposes of statistical analysis and presentation; they have no government of their own. *Definition from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unorganized_Borough,_Alaska){:target="_blank"}.*

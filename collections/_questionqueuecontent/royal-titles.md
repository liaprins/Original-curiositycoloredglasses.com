question: What are all the various royal titles, what does each mean, who gets to be what, and why?
---

Monarchies are ridiculous relics of a past built on fate over freedom (in my occasionally not-so-humble but unswervingly democratic opinion). Nonetheless, I'd like some insight into the structure behind the destinies these dynasties propagate: who gets what title and what does it mean? How do they all fit together hierarchically?

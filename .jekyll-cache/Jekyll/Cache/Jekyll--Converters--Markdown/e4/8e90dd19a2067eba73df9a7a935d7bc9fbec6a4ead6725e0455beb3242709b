I"®<p>You can buy whole, decaffeinated coffee beans. Preliminary research has revealed to me that these caffeine-less beans are not bred or otherwise genetically modified to grow this way, but that the caffeine is removed from them after harvestâ€¦somehow. I can more easily imagine already ground coffee in significantly smaller granular pieces with a higher surface-area-to-volume ratio being processed from the outside-in to extract the chemical caffeine, but how does this process happen, and how does it reach all the way into the insides of the whole beans?</p>

<p>Furthermore, why havenâ€™t coffee plants been bred to grow caffeine-less beans in the first place? Or have they?</p>

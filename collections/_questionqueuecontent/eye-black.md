question: (How) do the smears of black that athletes apply to their cheeks keep the sun out of their eyes?
binocsize: small

Black absorbs light, but it can't bend the light that is already on a trajectory straight into someone's pupil. Maybe these black patches just prevent light from reflecting off of one's cheeks into their eyes? Or maybe they do not do a thing to prevent sun blindness.

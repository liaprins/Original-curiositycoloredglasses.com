Intro: For my last quarter as a visual communication design student, we were each to design and create a project entirely of our own choosing. I was very excited about this. I wanted to help students learn complex scientific concepts in a way that made them feel both capable and excited for their own futures. I decided that I would strive to make learning basic biology as friction-free as possible.

####Opportunities

######1.) Textbooks as physical barriers to entry

Biology was my absolute favorite subject both in high school and undergrad, so I had become very familiar with the materials traditionally used to teach it: most notably the back-breaking, 3-inch-thick textbooks. These [huge] books posed a very physical limitation to consuming the subject matter: they were bad travelers. No one wants to lug them to coffee shops or schlep them along on bus (or bike!) commutes. Perhaps more importantly, the gargantuousness inherent to their design often felt intimidating, and I had found myself mentally measuring the reading I’d been assigned in fractions of inches rather than pages. 

######2.) The importance of strong (and lean) visuals

I started by examining several textbooks. Quickly I realized I was getting very distracted from my self-assigned task of assessing content organization strategies (and silently critiquing [several] [faddishly] out-of-date graphic [elements/designs]) by the photos and diagrams alongside the text-filled pages. The imagery was quite persuasive actually; I read several paragraphs within the vicinity of a compelling visual just to gain a more complete context. Strong visuals: this was a lesson I could carry forward.

My scrutiny of the vast majority of graphics I encountered did end up playing an informative role in my process. Yes, the diagrams pulled me in, but once they had my attention, I was often distracted by their low-quality rendering techniques and chaotically arranged elements. Labels and lines crowded the white space, while arrows galore attempted to illustrate a sequential biochemical process all in one go. Not only was my critical designer’s eye having a conniption over the gradient used to make a leaf look “3-D”, my brain was also just plain confused about where to look and what information to take in.

######3.) A relevant but hard-to-relate-to topic

Macrobiology had always felt intuitive to me: it deals with plants and animals, the patterns and behaviors of which humankind has been familiar with since our beginnings. But microbiology was another story: it is the study of seemingly invisible organisms and mechanisms, coupled with the aspects of physiology inherent to life itself. It is much more abstract than the more instinctually relatable concepts of macrobiology, yet the future of disease control and prevention, [nutrition], and much more depend on the youth of today taking an interest and continuing to make discoveries in this field. It seemed like an important challenge to take on within the world of education.

######4.) Putting big words to work

I chose to work with one chapter’s-worth of text about cells, and began to study it, to determine how to break it into conceptual chunks. As I deliberated, I came across several very large words. I had taken a class on common Greek and Latin roots within medicine when I was (briefly) a pre-med student, and I had always loved language, but these words were nonetheless slowing my comprehension. I made an assumption that the same would be true for other readers—and that stopping mid-sentence to look up the problem word in the book’s appendix, losing one’s place and context along the way, was not a viable solution.

[sketch of initial vocab explorations]

I made a concept map of all the big words (even the ones that I told myself I totally knew what they meant). Several of them described cell anatomy, which meant they could be depicted—and remembered—visually. Other words told of the processes performed by these structures, and the inherent chemical properties involved. I tried keeping the content organized by sections according to the cell organelles that performed primary functions. This approach felt the easiest to follow, and gave my brain a built-in way to compartmentalize the concepts, kind of like each organelle had its own file folder listing each of its responsibilities.

######TL;DR

1. The physicality of textbooks poses problems
    - bad travelers
    - scarily dense; not just in the literal sense
    - context is lost when reader stops to look something up
2. Textbook designs are stuck in 2-D
    - text:visuals ratio favors bibliophiles
    - diagrams often feel bloated
    - imagery can lack in care and attention to detail
3. Microbiology is an important but difficult subject
    - intangible: hard to grasp
    - invisible: may not intuitively relate back to real world at first glance
    - hard to know where to begin teaching
4. Multisyllabic terms give readers pause

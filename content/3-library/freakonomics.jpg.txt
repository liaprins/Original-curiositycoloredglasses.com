Heading: Freakonomics

----

About: Stephen Dubner, the host of this (link: http://freakonomics.com/archive/ text: podcast target: blank) and co-author of a book or two of the same name, is my favorite interviewer on the air. He is unbiased but exceedingly personable in his interrogations after the truth, siding with nothing short of critical thought. He manages to measure the seemingly unmeasurable—squishy social science things like the concept of creativity, for example—revealing every detail of his protocol along the way, and sussing out and scrutinizing those of others he talks to. I listen to the show as much for its intriguing content as for Dubner's journalistic methods.

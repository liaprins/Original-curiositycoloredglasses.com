Heading: Yoobi highlighters

----

About: Color-coding is an imperative part of my process when it comes to planning scripts and other complex code, so the more hues, the better. But that's not the only criteria that these (link: https://www.target.com/p/yoobi-153-mini-highlighters-multicolor-10-pack/-/A-15103318 text: mini highlighters target: blank) deliver on: each is only about the size of a blanket-less pig-in-a-blanket, but that's exactly what attracted me to them in the Target school supply aisle in the first place. Not only are tiny things great for their cuteness value, they're also convenient: I've toted all ten of these colorful li'l fluorescence-dispensing piggies to many a coffee shop in one of my favorite (also tiny) zippered pencil pouches for a working session.

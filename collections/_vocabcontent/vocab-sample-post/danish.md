A recipe for “pate de jujubes” was published in 1709. The recipe called for gum arabic, sugar, and the date-like jujube fruit. In 1853, both “ju ju paste” and “ju ju drops” were sold by confectioners. Later, recipes used various flavorings instead of jujube fruits. *Definition from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jujube_(confectionery)){:target="_blank"}.*

Intro: I am terrible at basketball, despite my 5’ 11” stature. Really any sport that involves a strategy more complex than “get to the finish line first”. Nonetheless, I was put through the local YMCA’s youth basketball program as a kid, and it was here, waiting for my (link: library#dad text: dad) to collect me after practice, that I first noticed a very peculiar porcelain specimen. It was next to the water fountain, and was similarly indented into the gym’s wall. Also like the drinking fountain, it had a handle that could be turned. Doing so trickled water from its small domed ceiling, down over a rusty stain, reminiscent of the interior of a dripping, stalactite-filled cavern I visited with my (link: library#greg text: brother), minus the stalactites of course. What could be the point of this? I wondered. In middle school, playing volleyball (even a worse choice for me than basketball) I came across near identical models in high school gymnasiums around the region. Often they were in disrepair: the handle was broken, or no water would run. Sometimes there was hair and chewed gum matted to the drain at the bottom. I never once saw anyone using one. Naturally such an enigmatic apparatus deserved further analysis!

My (link: library#mom text: mom)played basketball in high school and I think she always wished I liked basketball more.

I"z<p>Trader Joe’s sends out little newspaper-like missives every once in a while, cheekily and cheerfully touting the virtues of their newly stocked or seasonal items. I <em>love</em> reading them. I have a stack at least three inches high that I’ve been saving for years: they’ve survived every move and every massive apartment-wide purge I’ve ever undertaken in an attempt at minimalism. These grocery-centric <a href="https://www.traderjoes.com/fearless-flyer" target="_blank">newsletters</a> are just so joyous, silly, and self-aware; I dig into my stack whenever I need inspiration for finding my own writer’s voice.</p>

question: When to use a dash between dual-word descriptions?
binocsize: small

When I decided on a name for my blog, I realized I wasn't sure if I needed a hyphen between "curiosity" and "colored". It seemed to me like those two words acted as a single concept  to describe "glasses", but I also realized I had never learned any rules in school about what that means in terms of hyphenation. I've noticed these sorts of dual-word descriptions (like the phrase "dual-word descriptions" itself) pretty often in various literary settings, but I never could pick up on any consistency with regard to hyphens or lack thereof, probably because no one else remembered this grammar lesson either.

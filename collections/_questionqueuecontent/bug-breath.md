question: (How) do bugs breathe?

You know the drill: after you captured some sort of bug as a kid (or adult) you put it in a container, added grass, leaves, and sticks, and then *punched holes in the top to keep it from suffocating to death*. This implies an early understanding that insects breathe, just like other inhabitants of the animal kingdom. Well, maybe not *just like* other animalsâ€”how similar are insects' cardiovascular systems to ours? Do they have lungs? Do water beetles have gills? They aren't usually red when you squish them (except mosquitoes...), so that would seem to imply that they don't possess iron-toting red blood cells to do the job of oxygenating their various bodily systems. So how do bugs breathe?

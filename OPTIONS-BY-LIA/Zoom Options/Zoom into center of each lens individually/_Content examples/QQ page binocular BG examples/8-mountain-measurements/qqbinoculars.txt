Question: How are mountains measured on planets and moons without seas (and therefore without sea levels)?

Explanation: I always thought that measuring a mountain's height based solely upon its peak's altitude above sea level was a bit of a cop-out: is the *mountain* really that tall itself? Or is it just standing on the shoulders of a very tall plateau, so to speak? Then again, determining the base from which to measure any mountain seems like quite the slippery slope once you get down to it, so I do understand and sympathize with the sea level approach adopted by us Earthlings. But what about pinnacle-filled planets that nonetheless lack oceans: how are their mountains measured? And even on Earth, how are high and low tides reconciled in order to arrive at such specific heights down to individual feet and even inches in some cases?

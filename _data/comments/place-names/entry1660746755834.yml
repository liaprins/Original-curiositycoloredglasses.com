  Very neat! Just a heads up, looks like many of the counties of Massachusetts
  are shuffled around. The Town and County of Nantucket is an island off the
  coast, but hovering over that gives information about Norfolk County. Hovering
  over Norfolk County gives a label of Plymouth County, and then Plymouth County
  has info for Suffolk County, which then loops back to Nantucket. Not sure
  where this error is coming in (whether it's your dataset or was lost in
  translation somewhere or what), but thought you'd want to know :)

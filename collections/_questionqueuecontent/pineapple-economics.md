question: Is pineapple the lowest performing crop of all time?
binocsize: small

I have heard—from a co-worker, who heard from a tour guide in Hawai'i (more fact checking to come)—that a single pineapple takes two years to grow. Factor in the cost of Hawai'ian land and overseas climate-controlled shipping, and you have yourself an economic mystery …  or at least a conspiracy theory waiting to be created. How are these things *not* worth their weight in gold?

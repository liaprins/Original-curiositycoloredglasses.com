Caption: 

The Island of Hawaiâ€™i, which includes Mauna Kea as well as other volcanoes, is so massive that it puts a literal dent in the crust below it. This in turn results in a seafloor trough ringing the region, as well as an arch further out where the crust is raised about 200 meters (656 feet) above the rest of the seabed.

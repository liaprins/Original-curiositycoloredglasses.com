question: What do mosquitos prioritize in blood?
binocsize: small

I've heard all kinds of anecdotal rationale for why mosquitoes love some people's blood more than others, and consequently, why some people are perpetually bitten while others aren'tâ€”everything from banana breath to blood type. Is there any truth to these notions or are they old wives tails?

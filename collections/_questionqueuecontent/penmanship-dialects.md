question: Why do people form different letter forms?
binocsize: large

We hosted a Spanish exchange student over the summer one year in high school and I noticed that she wrote her lowercase *a*’s by making a *U*, then a cursive *o*’s loop at the top, before descending to create the *a*'s tail. When I asked her about it, she said that was how they always learned to make them in school.

Since then I have noticed all sorts of penmanship idiosyncrasies, often tied to the country of the writer's birth. I want to catalog these handwriting conventions of the latin alphabet, character-by-character, and trace them back to their roots.

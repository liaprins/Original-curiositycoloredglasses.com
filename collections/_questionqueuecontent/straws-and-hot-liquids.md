question: Why do liquids seem hotter when sipped through a straw?

Is there a threshold for this perceived temperature increase? Or are cold liquids also perceived by our nerves to be relatively warmer than they would have been if sipped straight from the cup? Maybe we don't notice this phenomena with cold liquids because they don't threaten to char our tongues for eternity like straw-sipped hot liquids do?

Or, as my ever-sensible mom suggested to me, the liquid must be hotter at the bottom of the cup, where the straw pulls from, than the top, where the liquid touches air. This had not even occurred to me [insert face-palm emoji]. But still we must test to verify!

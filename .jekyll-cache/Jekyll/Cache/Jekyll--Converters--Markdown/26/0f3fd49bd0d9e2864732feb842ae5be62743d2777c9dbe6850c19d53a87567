I"C<p>How come water tension can bulge on a penny, but not to an equivalent height on a humungous 100-mile wide disc (at least I assume it can’t …)? A penny is still <em>enormous</em> compared to the individual water molecules responsible for water tension. So what is the size threshold for this water tension trick?</p>

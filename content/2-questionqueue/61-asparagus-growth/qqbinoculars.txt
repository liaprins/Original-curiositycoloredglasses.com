Explanation: Asparagus grows 10 inches per day for 6 weeks in the spring! And they harvest it everyday, down to there being nothing showing! But how does the asparagus plant have enough energy to grow this much? The leaves are too tiny to gather much chlorophyll energy from the sun and also there is not enough time for them to send energy down to store in their roots since each leaflet only exists for less than one day in the first place! It definitely takes more energy to grow a stalk than the stalk collects in its short life and sends down to the roots, so how does this math equation work out?

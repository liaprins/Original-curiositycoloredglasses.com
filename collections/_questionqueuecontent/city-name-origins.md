question: Where do town and city names across America come from?
---

Everytime I travel to the east coast for work, I become hyper-aware of the differences in the names of many of the cities and towns, compared to where I grew up in the Pacific Northwest. Whereas the west seems to be dominated by Native American names, the East is peppered with old-school Englishy-sounding monikers. It makes me wonder how correlated the various nomenclatures are to the dates of their cities' founding, and the time and way in which the land they lay upon was acquired.

If I made a map categorizing each city's name type, what would it reveal? Could I trace the border's of each subsequent parsel of land purchased and instated to the Union by its city's name types alone?

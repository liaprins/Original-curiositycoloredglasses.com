Heading: The best school supply

About: (link: http://localhost:8888/kirby-project/kirby-2.4.0/blog/flourescence-and-phosphorescence text: Crayola) crayons were my tool of choice from age 4 through at least age 10. I still instinctively describe colors according to their Crayola counterparts, like radical raspberry. And I know the real hue of cerulean is the one of the Crayola crayon. So thanks, Crayola, for getting off to a creative start.

Question: Must they really shoot race horses that break their legs?

Explanation: 

(Why) do they always kill a horse if it breaks a leg? Why not put a cast on it and prop it up in a small pen where it can't move for a month or so? Yes, that sounds miserable, but not compared to *killing* an amazingly intelligent creature of which thousands of dollars have probably already been invested. In Sri Lanka I saw an elephant that had stepped on a land mine and it would never walk again, but they didn't kill it. Also, my cousin works for a veterinarian and has put a cast on a calf with a broken legâ€”what's stopping that from being the default for horses?

Furthermore, shooting seems such an inefficient and cruel death, hopefully they at least get a vet to euthanize them, but somehow I had heard they shoot them. Reform is in order if so.

I"Ã<p>This is more than just an artistic coffee table book; it bears an honest and enlightening account of the struggles involved in making oneâ€™s living as a creative. I love Niemannâ€™s <a href="http://www.christophniemann.com/portfolio/sunday-sketches-2/" target="_blank">illustrations</a> as much for their cleverness as for their simplicity and craftsmanship: every line and ink wash is perfectly placed, in a way that comes off as effortless.</p>

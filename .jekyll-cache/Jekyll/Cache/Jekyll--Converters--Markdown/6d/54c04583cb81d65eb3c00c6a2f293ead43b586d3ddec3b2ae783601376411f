I"ô<p><a href="https://getkirby.com/" target="_blank">Kirby</a> is the infrastructure behind the content management system (CMS) I built into this very website. Itâ€™s extremely flexible and well documented, which is why I chose it: I couldnâ€™t find any other CMS that would let me design and build-in all the little content-filled details I had in mind, while providing web performance equivalent to a static site. However, it was not an easy task at all; Kirby uses PHP, so I had to learn that coding language from scratch, the syntax of which leaves much to be desired. Kirby has a fantastically responsive forum though, and they helped me with nearly every challenge I encountered and could not solve through my own sheer will and external research.</p>
